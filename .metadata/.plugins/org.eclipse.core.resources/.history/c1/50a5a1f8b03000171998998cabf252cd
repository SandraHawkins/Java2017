/*
 * A simple dice game is played with two dice (store that 
 * values in two variables). For a normal dice throw, the 
 * amount of points you get will be calculated by multiplying 
 * the eyes from each dice, i.e. a throw of 4 and 2 would 
 * give you 8 points. There are some exceptions to this rule:
 * 
 * • 6 is a special number: Whenever at least one 6 is 
 *     thrown, the sum of the eyes will be used instead of 
 *     the multiplication.
 * • 3 is your lucky number: For each 3, you will get 10 
 *     bonus points.
 * • 5 is your unlucky number: For each 5, your score will 
 *     be decreased by 4 points.
